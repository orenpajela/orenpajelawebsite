      <p class="case-study-header-2">Introduction</p>
      <p class="case-study-paragraph">CVS had recently launched Pulse 2.0, a new design system featuring an upgraded UI Kit with modernized components. While an improvement over its predecessor, the system's comprehensiveness, encompassing a wide range of font sizes, spacing guidelines, and color palettes, presented a significant usability challenge. This complexity hindered design consistency across the organization. To address this, our initial focus was on a thorough understanding of the entire design system to identify and leverage its most readily applicable elements, and create a micro design system (mDS) that would be used by our MinuteClinic business unit.</p>

        <div>
          <p class="case-study-paragraph">A comprehensive analysis of the design system and its constituent components was undertaken. Subsequently, a comparative analysis of the system and prior design work was conducted to identify and prioritize the most valuable design artifacts. It encompassed a wide array of font sizes, spacing guidelines, color palettes, and other elements, making it difficult to navigate and apply effectively. This complexity often resulted in inconsistencies and a lack of visual cohesion across designs produced throughout the organization. <br></p>

        <p class="case-study-header-2 _2">Challenge #2: Understanding the Problem</p>
        <div class="div-block-13">
          <p class="case-study-paragraph">A design system is a collection of reusable components that can be used to create consistent and user-friendly interfaces. It is built on the atomic design methodology, which breaks down design into its smallest components, or atoms. These atoms combine to form molecules, which in turn combine to form organisms. Templates are made up of organisms. Much of the CVS design system contained atoms and molecules, and we discovered a big need to help create organisms and templates for our train.</p><img src="images/atomic-design.jpeg" loading="lazy" width="618" sizes="(max-width: 479px) 92vw, (max-width: 767px) 80vw, 600px" srcset="images/atomic-design.jpeg 500w, images/atomic-design.jpeg 800w, images/atomic-design.jpeg 1080w, images/atomic-design.jpeg 1200w" alt="" class="no-padding-image _600px">
          <p class="case-study-paragraph">In order to verify our hypothesis, James and I created the UI Office Hours. Our intention was to create an open space for all designers to attend and have a discussion about the UI Kit and how to implement guidelines for their every day designs. This was especially helpful for all of the UX designers who had to step into UI design, and the office hours served as a place for learning and open collaboration. In addition, we were able to ask the members of our team about what they felt was specifically missing in the design system, essentially serving as a place where we would interview them to discover how the mDS team could best be useful for them.<br></p><img src="images/understanding-problem.svg" loading="lazy" width="605" alt="" class="rectangle-image">

        <p class="case-study-paragraph">After diving deeper into the CVS design system, looking into examples of current designs, and talking with the designers across the organization, we looked to create design artifacts what would be usable to the team. One of the biggest asks from the designers was to create guidelines for how spacing was used. Consequently, we standardized how to use spacing across the train, while also creating a Figma file with all of the mDS guidelines.<br></p><img src="images/Component-Spacing.svg" loading="lazy" width="338" alt="" class="no-padding-image _480px">
        <p class="case-study-paragraph">However, we didn&#x27;t stop just at spacing. There were many needs that our designs had asked for, so we worked to standardize color usage, typography, and even design annotations. Eventually we worked up to create templates that would showcase the most used components within our specific train and how to use the design system in a way that was cohesive and aligned with overarching CVS goals.<br></p><img src="images/templates.svg" loading="lazy" width="514" alt="" class="no-padding-image _600px">

      <p class="case-study-paragraph">The implementation of the CVS Pulse design system necessitated a comprehensive redesign of all pages and user flows within the MinuteClinic website. As a UX Designer on the Scheduling team, I was tasked with leading the redesign of the critical Planner Page, the primary tool patients utilize to schedule medical appointments at MinuteClinic. </p>

        <div>
          <p class="case-study-paragraph">As a mobile-first company, CVS prioritizes delivering exceptional mobile experiences. Consequently, the redesign of the Planner Page began with a mobile-first approach, optimizing the user journey for mobile viewports. Recognizing the significant desktop and tablet user base (approximately 20-25%), we ensured a seamless experience across all devices. Every design project, including the Planner Page redesign, adhered to a multi-device design process encompassing mobile, desktop, and tablet viewports. Close collaboration with our engineering team was critical throughout the process to guarantee that the final product in each viewport precisely matched the approved designs.</p>

          <p class="case-study-paragraph">Following the completion of the Planner Page designs, CVS established a key business objective: achieving 500,000 virtual MinuteClinic visits in 2023. This necessitated a reassessment of the user experience to identify opportunities for promoting virtual care options. Recognizing CVS's strong emphasis on efficiency, we identified a valuable opportunity to integrate virtual care options directly within the Planner Page. This was achieved by implementing a series of "tiles" at the bottom of the page, presenting users with alternative care options, such as virtual visits, for scenarios where an in-person appointment was not feasible.</p>

        <p class="case-study-header-2 _2">Challenge #3: Future Considerations</p><img src="images/future-considerations.svg" loading="lazy" alt="" class="no-padding-image _480px">
        <p class="case-study-paragraph">Recognizing the impending rollout of the Unified Design System, we actively collaborated with designers from various CVS lines of business (Pharmacy, Immunizations, MinuteClinic, and Behavioral Health) throughout the Planner Page redesign. This collaborative approach ensured that the design not only met immediate needs but also seamlessly integrated with the broader Unified Design System vision, fostering a consistent and user-friendly scheduling experience across the entire CVS enterprise.<br></p><img src="images/365-days.svg" loading="lazy" alt="" class="no-padding-image _600px">
        <p class="case-study-paragraph">Concurrently with the Unified Design System initiative, a significant challenge emerged: enabling users to schedule appointments up to 365 days in advance. While a long-term vision, this enhancement was crucial for user flexibility and required cross-disciplinary collaboration. To ensure feasibility, we maintained open communication with the Architecture team throughout the design process. Through iterative design and close collaboration with Product, Engineering, and Design leadership, we successfully developed a 365-day scheduling solution that met both user needs and technical constraints.<br></p>

          <p class="case-study-paragraph">CVS operates with a strong emphasis on operational efficiency. Revenue maximization within this framework necessitates a two-pronged approach: increasing patient visit volume and mitigating the impact of appointment cancellations. Recognizing the significant revenue leakage associated with no-shows, the patient waitlist initiative was strategically implemented to minimize appointment abandonment and optimize resource utilization.<br></p>

        <p class="case-study-header-2 _2">Challenge #2: Entry Points and User Flows</p>
        <div class="div-block-13">
          <p class="case-study-paragraph">As part of our initial investigation, we meticulously documented the existing MinuteClinic patient journey through the creation of comprehensive user flows. This served as a foundational step, providing a holistic understanding of the current experience and identifying key opportunities for seamless waitlist integration. Moreover, these user flows served as a dynamic representation of the patient journey, ensuring that any design iterations were accurately reflected and maintained throughout the project lifecycle.</p><img src="images/user-flows.svg" loading="lazy" width="515" alt="" class="no-padding-image _600px">
          <p class="case-study-paragraph">Through careful analysis of the user journey, we identified two optimal points for integrating the Patient Waitlist functionality. The first integration point is directly on the Planner Page, offering users the option to join the waitlist when their desired appointment times are unavailable. The second integration point is strategically placed on the Patient Information Page, providing users with the opportunity to opt-in to the waitlist during the appointment scheduling process, offering them peace of mind and the potential for an earlier appointment.<br></p><img src="images/Entry-Point.svg" loading="lazy" alt="" class="no-padding-image _720px">

        <p class="case-study-paragraph">Successful cross-disciplinary collaboration is paramount in any design project. In this instance, a critical technical limitation identified by the Architecture team presented a significant challenge. With the release date looming at the end of the month, we were faced with the necessity of rapidly adapting our designs to accommodate unforeseen constraints.<br><br>This unforeseen obstacle necessitated a thorough re-evaluation of the user flows, resulting in the identification of 40 additional scenarios that required careful consideration. This involved the rapid prototyping of new screens, error states, and UI components to address these unforeseen contingencies. The meticulously documented user flows proved invaluable to the engineering team, ensuring a smooth transition from design to development.<br><br>Despite this unexpected challenge, we successfully met the project deadline, delivering the Patient Waitlist feature on schedule. This achievement not only demonstrated the team's resilience and adaptability but also solidified the value of the Patient Waitlist as a significant success for both the organization and the user experience.<br></p>
