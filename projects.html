      <p class="paragraph projects">This website is a personal project of mine with a multitude of different purposes. I&#x27;ve been really interested in the idea of creating a sort of personal memex, and hopefully this website can evolve into something that would resemble what my vision of a personal memex would look like. You can argue the the internet in it&#x27;s entirety is the closest thing to what humanity&#x27;s memex would be like, so if I&#x27;m able to influence my own little dent in the internet through this website, maybe I could create my own.<br><br>There&#x27;s a lot of fun plans that I&#x27;m hoping to do through this site as I continue to work on it, but all-in-all I want to use it as a tool for my own personal and professional growth and development. I also plan to use it as a communication tool through my Weblog, to advance my career as a freelancer and to communicate with potential employers.<br><br>If you&#x27;re reading this, that means that this website is currently a work-in-progress. I like to leave behind little easter eggs, so feel free to click around and see if you could discover something interesting!<br></p>

      <h2 class="project-header">Roof</h2>
      <p class="paragraph projects">Roof was the idea I pitched for the Big Idea Competition at the University of Texas at Dallas for my Master&#x27;s program. While I didn&#x27;t win the competition, I did get to the semi-finals and pitched <br><br>The idea was to create a Social Media Service as a service where users owned and controlled their own content and personal information, not big tech giants (e.g. Facebook/Meta). Users would own their own data utilizing Web3 technology, and Roof was a Social Network as a Service where we would host and deploy social media networks for various organizations. Think of it like the ability to create your own Facebook or Instagram for communities that matter to you, and where you don&#x27;t have to worry about how your data is collected and used.<br><br>Roof was ideated out of concern for the current path of technology and social media, where profits are prioritized over people, where bots run rampant, etc. If you want to take a look at the pitch deck, <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/13mH91gCkDWkCif8NiJ_2w3e7bhbAJ2XhpaTKMG_UYJk/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank" class="text-link">click here</a>.<br></p>

      <h2 class="project-header">NextLevel Tutoring</h2>
      <p class="paragraph projects">For most of my college career, in both my undergrad and graduate programs, I worked as a tutor for over 6 years. It started mostly with high school physics, because that&#x27;s what most of the kids needed help with, but over time I began to tutor in a lot of different subjects: chemistry, calculus, algebra, etc.<br><br>Eventually, I picked up a lot more knowledge and skills in my education, and I started teaching college students with their subjects too: economics, statistics, marketing. Throughout the years, I taught a smorgasbord of different subjects, I even taught some students how to play instruments and others how to design logos and make websites. <br><br>NextLevel Tutoring was birthed through all of these experiences so that I could continue teaching kids even during the COVID-19 pandemic. Ultimately, I&#x27;d love to plug in a virtual platform that allows me to switch different video inputs (from my laptop and/or my iPad), keep track of students progress, chat with students and parents, etc. <br></p>

      <h2 class="project-header">Logolaunch</h2>
      <p class="paragraph projects">This project was originally my first entrepreneurial attempt. It started off as Rocket Launch Creative, and I first started off by hiring designers as contractors for the business in order to sell creative design services: Logos, websites, illustrations, etc. <br><br>It got to the point where the quality of the work that the organization was producing just wasn&#x27;t high enough for the standard I wanted to set, and as a student myself, I was intimidated by approaching high quality professional designers to hire as contractors and I was stuck with a budget of hiring low quality designers and getting low quality work. In hindsight, I think taking the jump to get the best contractors for the company might have worked out, but I wouldn&#x27;t have taken the personal dive<br><br>I fell in love with design and creativity through this process, and in some ways it has spoiled me professionally because I love the constant learning, creating, and building that I do that I feel very little career paths offer. Eventually Rocket Launch Creative turned into the brand that I use for my own personal freelance design work: Logolaunch.<br></p>
